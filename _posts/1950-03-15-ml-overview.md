The ways computers think, reason, and solves problems can be quite similar to humans. Brains are made of cells called neurons, computers are made of switches called transistors. There are sequence of instructions called algorithms telling a transistor what to do: switching on and off. The electrical state of one transistor is one bit of information: one if the transistor is on, and zero if it's off. 

Claude Shannon as the father of information theory, find out what transistors are doing, they are reasoning when they switch on and off in response to other transistors, by using one and zero instead of words. For example, if transistor C turns on when transistor A and B are both on, is a logical reasoning called AND operation. By combining many such operations (OR, XOR, NAND, etc.), computer can carry out a very elaborate chains of logical reasoning. 

A modern computer is a vast assembly of transistors that can do many different things, based on which transistors are activated. Like poet write poetry putting together the unique combination of words to stimulate our imaginations; programmer write program putting together the efficient and enhanced algorithms to activate transistors. The difference between neuron and transistor is that, a neuron makes thousands of connections with other neurons whereas a transistor is usually only connected to a few other transistors.

Fortunately, computer can use speed to compensate the lack of connectivity by having transistors switching on and off billions of times per second. However, by having massively connected neurons, human can process complex information much faster than computer in certain tasks. For example, it takes us only about a tenth of a second to recognize the face of someone we know. This is barely enough time for transistors' hundred steps of processing. Just about hundred steps per tenth of a second, the brain can scan our entire memory and recognize the same person we know when she's in different clothes, different hairstyles etc. 

Machine learning as a branch of artificial intelligence, aims to mimic such humans' intelligent abilities in computer program, to turn those theoretical hundred steps of human's problem solving into algorithms. In contrast to following explicitly programmed instructions, machine learning is concerned with the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn, by building a system called model, and let the model to take in some example inputs called data and produce some output result for data-driven predictions or decisions. Such algorithms automate the process of building a model that fine-tune its input and output for optimal prediction on new cases (to take in new input and produce the right output). 

The following are ten common machine learning algorithms which can be applied to almost any data problem: 1. Linear Regression, 2. Logistic Regression, 3. Decision Tree, 4. Support Vector Machine, 5. Naive Bayes, 6. K-Nearest Neighbors, 7. K-Means, 8. Random Forest, 9. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms, and 10. Gradient Boost & Adaboost. The subsequent posts will introduce one algorithm at a time and its sample application.
