title: "What is Artificial Intelligence?"

	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that studies how to create computer and its software that show intelligent behaviour. The term AI was coined by John McCarthy in 1955 in his proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, defined it as "making a machine behaves in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving". The exploration about intelligent machines has begun long before the computer was invented. The many different strands of AI make it difficult for us to see what it is for.

	There is the economic question of why bother to create intelligence artificially; let alone the philosophical question of whether or not it is a good idea to even try, many people get involved in AI and there is a new wave of AI breakthroughs makes it possible for technology to do all sorts of things we can't believe at first. AI helps making our lives easier and more productive, and raising a new round of excitement about where it is headed. Christopher Bishop said that "Right now we're in a phase of very fast advances, and that may well continue for a small number of years."

	These new advances are driven by consumers, who have quickly found their feet in a world where technology understands everyday speech, recommends books and movies, filters email inbox for unwanted spam, and provides the fastest route to desired destination in rush hour traffic. These are weak AI solutions from the engineering approach that simply wants to create software to accomplish specific tasks that do not encompass the full range of human cognitive abilities. On the other hand, strong AI is a hypothetical form of computer that can be given the ability to think, reason, and solve problems on a level equal to or better than human.

	At its most extreme, strong AI enthusiasts aim to create an artificial consciousness. Something that can say, and really mean in the way that humans do, that it knows it exists and wants to continue to exist. This is the premise of many a good sci-fi move. The ideal Strong AI machine would be built in the form of a man, have the same sensory perception as a human, and go through the same education and learning processes as a human child. Essentially, the machine would be "born" as a child and eventually develop to an adult in a way analogous to human development. This is strong AI solution from the symbolic approach to create human intelligence in computer.

	The computer would only be given the ability to interact with the environment and the ability to learn from those interactions from the beginning. As time passed, the computer "grows up" gaining adult-like knowledge and language on its own. This paradigm seeks to combine the mind and the body. However, the common trend in symbolic programming has been to ignore the body and focus on the computer's intellect. For example, the CYC project aims to build a rule database that is so complete and all encompassing that it will become intelligent in the sense that it will be able to discuss topics and eventually reach the limits of human knowledge. Once it is at the limits of human knowledge, it will push on and invent new knowledge.

	In addition, the types of rules that it uses have been extended to include logical expressions. The program is also able to modify and add to the rule database and every night it is left to “think over” the day’s input. In the morning, researchers check out the new rules it has created to see if they are reasonable. This is a very ambitious project and many claim that the rule base will become hopelessly inconsistent long before it is complete. At the moment the project has served more to point out the difficulties of this approach than it has demonstrated that it works. Therefore, strong AI development is overshadowed by the immediate applications of weak AI which yields more tangible and quantifiable results. There are many more side tracks of symbolic or engineering approach to AI. At the core, the two approaches use probabilities or high-speed comparisons to draw conclusions. Though computers are able to perform tasks far beyond the ability of humans, they could not mimic human intuition in problem solving. Because intuition is an unique individual possession of each person that cannot be recreated and downloaded.

	In the meantime, there is no general measure of "success" in the field of strong AI. The concept of intelligence varies from person to person and thus, a standardized test like Turing Test becomes less important. The Turing Test which was invented by Alan Turing has been a way to define intelligence, by using the "black box" approach, that is, if the computer behaves like a human intelligence then it is a human intelligence regardless of how it works. Turing Test avoids the problem of understanding kills off the very appearance of intelligence, that is, what seems to be intelligent intriguingly on the stage lost its magic charm once you know how it works. This is the curse of strong AI, no matter how intelligent a computer candidate passing the Turing Test, once the curtain removed and the human judge learns how the machine did it, the magical intelligence evaporates. At this point, it is reasonable to avoid the "how". By its nature, intelligence is something that cannot be understood, because understanding it destroys our perception of it as intelligence.

	Hence, the time has come to find out some alternatives. One of the main characters of human intelligence is learning, which is the missing part of symbolic program that can't learn by itself. Very early on in the history of AI, people looked specifically at the ability to learn and tried to build learning machines. The theory was that if you could build a machine that could learn a little more than you told it, you could “bootstrap” your way to a complete intelligent machine equal to or better than a human. After all this is how natural selection worked to create organisms that could learn more and more. This escorts us into the path of machine learning, a branch of AI that studies how to gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (topic for next post). To wrap up for this topic, AI is still in its infancy and true intelligence is still a long way over the horizon.
